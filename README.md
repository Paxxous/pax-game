# Hello!

*Every single readme is the same anyways...*

This is a game currently being created by me, paxs!

Here's how it's all organized inside of the src folder:

* The game itself, first files inside of the src folder, the fun stuff! It's where the true content lives.
* The engine folder, the most important thing in there is the engine namespace, which holds thinks like the entity class, player class, deltatime, all of the fun stuff! All of which I'm *hoping* to keep near the basic rules of Object Oriented Programming.

Feel free to explore the codebase! Maybe you'll learn something new!!!

I'm structuring all of this through creativity, so ideas may be efficient or inefficient

*this was programmed in vim... [VIM POWER >:DDD](https://neovim.io/)*
